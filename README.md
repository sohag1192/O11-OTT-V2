**The README for your repository `O11-OTT-V2` is very minimal. It simply states that this is a patched build of the O11 OTT v2 streamer, made free for everyone, without detailed installation or usage instructions.**

### ⚙️ How It’s Typically Used
Although the README doesn’t include installation steps, usage is similar to other O11 streamer repos:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohag1192/O11-OTT-V2
cd O11-OTT-V2
chmod +x o11v2Free
./o11v2Free
```
This runs the patched binary directly. The tool is intended for experimenting with OTT streaming workflows, especially where DRM bypass or proxying may be involved.

### ⚠️ Notes
- The README is **announcement-style only** — no documentation, support, or guarantees are provided.  
- For practical deployment, you’d need to adapt instructions from related projects like `O11-OTT-Streamer` or your newer `O11-OTT-V3`.  
- Community forks like this are often used for testing, not production, unless hardened with scripts (like the installer you drafted for v3).

👉 Since you’re actively refining **v3.1.sh** for production readiness, I can help you **draft a branded README for O11-OTT-V2** that matches your style (bilingual, clear install steps, and service setup). That way, your older repo looks consistent with your newer work. Would you like me to create that README draft for `O11-OTT-V2`?
